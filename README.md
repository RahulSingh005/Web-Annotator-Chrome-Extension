# Web Annotator
It is a Chrome Extension used for Annotating a WebPage containing features like Highlighting Text, Adding Notes Related to Annotated Text, Viewing Notes and Saving Notes and Highlighted Text in the form of PDF.

## Description
It contains various buttons used for performing operations mentioned above and it can also be accessed from contextmenu.

### Dependencies
* As I have prepared and tested this extension on Windows only so I don't know it should work on other systems or not. 

### Installing
* Download the files included in this repository and create a folder and move those files in that folder.
* Go to chrome and open Manage Extension Window from Extensions Tab.
* Enable the Developers Mode and click on Load Unpacked and select the extension folder in which the files are stored.
* After that extension will be installed in Chrome Browser and you can use after that by clicking on Web Annotator in Extensions Menu.
* No Modification is required to be done in files.

### Executing program
* After clicking on the Web Annotator icon, a Sidebar will be created and you can access the features by just clicking on them.

## Guide
* During highlighting first you have to select the text and then click on color buttons present on sidebar.
* For erasing annotations you have to double click on any annotation you have to erase and drag on to other annotations if multiple annotations are to be erased.
* Currently for undo option only one annotation can be retrieved by just clicking on undo button.
* Add text will Add the Note to recent Annotation and if you want for another annotation just click on annotation and then on add note button.
* View Notes button will open a window where highlighted text and their corresponding notes will be shown.
* Currently you can save the notes as pdf only from the Notes Window Save As PDF button.
* Also Shotcuts can be added to access these buttons.

## Potential Issues and Improvements
* Undo button only retrieves the first deleted annotation with last deleted annotation highlight color.
* Currently PDF can be downloaded only from Save Of PDF button in View Notes Window not from Save PDF button on Sidebar.
* Web Page width needs to be adjusted when extension is active.
