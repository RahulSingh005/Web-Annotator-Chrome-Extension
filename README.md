## Description
It contains various buttons in sidebar which are used to perform the features mentioned above.

### Dependencies
* As I have prepared and tested this extension on Windows only so I don't know it should work on other systems or not. 

### Installing
* Clone the repository or download it in zip file and extract it to a seperate folder.
* Go to chrome and open Manage Extension Window from Extensions Tab.
* Enable the Developers Mode and click on Load Unpacked and select the extension folder in which the files are stored.
* After that extension will be installed in Chrome Browser and you can use after that by clicking on Web Annotator in Extensions Menu.
* No Modification is required to be done in files.

### Executing program
* After clicking on the Web Annotator icon, a sidebar will be opened and you can access the features by just clicking on them.

## Guide
* During highlighting select the appropriate color button and then select the text you want to highlight.
* For erasing also select the button and click on the annotations you want to erase.

* View Notes button will open a window where highlighted text and their corresponding notes will be shown and you can edit the notes from there as well.

## Potential Issues and Improvements
